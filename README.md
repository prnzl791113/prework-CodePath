## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
I like the functionality of safari in mac's where you can just slide two fingers left to back to the last website and right to the next.
I also like how sliding inwards from right corner opens weather and other notifications.
I also like how newer messages and emails are brought to the top in snapchat and gmail.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Navigating xcode was pretty difficult, there is just too much going on or maybe it is because I am new to xcode.
